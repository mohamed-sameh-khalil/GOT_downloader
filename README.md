# GOT_downloader
This is a small python script I wrote to download the newest episode of game of thrones while I was sleeping
for reuse one would need to setup the change the name of his torrent client in the bat file and change the url of the show he wants to download from ettvtorrents in the python file
You Also need to add a task in windows task scheduler to run the bat file at the desired time each week. The computer needs to be turned on at the time
